Install kafka and zookeeper:

Installing Zookeeper:

1- Download: http://zookeeper.apache.org/releases.html#download
2- Copy and Rename “zoo_sample.cfg” to “zoo.cfg” in the conf folder.
3- Find & edit dataDir=/tmp/zookeeper to a path which is one level up from the bin directory using any text editor like notepad or notepad++. (change the zookeeper version as yours)
ex: dataDir=C:\\Tools\\zookeeper\\zookeeper-3.4.9 (You can also type in an absolute windows path starting from root C:\\)
4- Add entries in System Environment Variables: 
	Add in System Variables ZOOKEEPER_HOME = the directory of zookeeper
	Edit System Variable named “Path” and append this in the last : %ZOOKEEPER_HOME%\bin

Installing Kafka:

1- Download: http://kafka.apache.org/downloads.html
2- Go to your Kafka config directory.
3- There is a sample server.properties file that we can start with.
For one broker we just need to set up this one file. If we need multiple brokers then duplicate this file once for each broker. For example, if you need 2 message brokers then you’ll end up with server.b1.properties and server.b2.properties.
In each file, you’ll change the following: 
	The broker id
	# The id of the broker. This must be set to a unique integer for each broker.
	broker.id=0
	If you’re just using 1 broker then leave it at 0. Nothing to change. If you have another broker then change the id in the other files so they are unique.

Change the log dir you can keep it to an absolute path. You can use any Windows-style pathing here
# A comma separated list of directories under which to store log files
log.dirs=C:\Apache\kafka_2.12–2.3.1\logs
